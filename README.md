# Code Generalization Theory Wiki

This collection explores the theoretical foundations of code generalization and abstraction in computer science, bridging academic theory with practical engineering applications.

## Quick Navigation

### Core Theory Pages
- 📚 [**Main Index**](./code-generalization-theory-index.md) - Start here for an overview
- 🎯 [**Type Theory & Parametricity**](./type-theory-parametricity.md) - Mathematical foundations of generic code
- 🚧 [**Complexity Boundaries**](./complexity-boundaries.md) - Fundamental limits from Rice's theorem to P vs NP
- 🔬 [**Abstract Interpretation**](./abstract-interpretation.md) - Sound approximation of program semantics
- 🏗️ [**Infrastructure as Code Patterns**](./iac-patterns.md) - Theory applied to DevOps and cloud infrastructure

## Purpose

These wiki pages are designed to:

1. **Bridge Theory and Practice**: Connect abstract computer science concepts to real-world engineering challenges
2. **Support Technical Education**: Provide material for mentoring and knowledge transfer
3. **Document Patterns**: Capture recurring themes in code abstraction and generalization
4. **Enable Deep Understanding**: Go beyond "how" to understand "why" certain approaches work or fail

## How These Connect to Your Work

### DevOps & Infrastructure (HSBC)
- The IaC Patterns page directly relates to your Terraform and HashiCorp Vault work
- Abstract Interpretation concepts underpin security scanning and policy-as-code tools
- Type theory principles appear in Terraform's type system and validation

### Complexity Theory Research
- Complexity Boundaries page links directly to your P vs NP exploration
- Shows how theoretical limits affect practical system design
- Connects undecidability results to real engineering constraints

### Technical Education & Mentoring
- Each page includes practical examples and exercises
- Structured for progressive learning
- Can be used as reference material for workshops

## Integration Ideas

### For Your GitHub Repository

```markdown
## Theoretical Foundations
- [Code Generalization Theory](./wiki/code-generalization/)
  - How far can we abstract?
  - Mathematical limits of generalization
  - Practical patterns and anti-patterns
```

### For Blog Posts

These topics could expand into blog series:
- "Why Your Infrastructure Code Can't Be Perfectly Generic"
- "Type Theory for DevOps Engineers"

- "Abstract Interpretation in CI/CD Pipelines"

### For Training Materials

Workshop modules:
1. **Foundation**: Type systems and parametricity
2. **Boundaries**: What's possible vs impossible
3. **Techniques**: Abstract interpretation in practice
4. **Application**: IaC patterns and anti-patterns

## Extending This Wiki

### Suggested Additions

- AI agent architectures and complexity theory
- Mental health tech and accessibility in documentation

## Technical Notes

### Format
- Written in CommonMark-compliant Markdown
- Code examples in multiple languages (Haskell, Python, HCL, YAML)
- Academic citations included for depth
- Practical examples from real tools and systems

### Audience
- Senior engineers wanting deeper understanding
- DevOps practitioners exploring theoretical foundations
- CS students connecting theory to practice

## Using These Pages

### As Reference
- Each page stands alone but links create a web of concepts
- Use the index page for navigation
- Code examples are meant to be experimented with

### For Learning
1. Start with the main index
2. Follow your interests - pages interconnect naturally
3. Try implementing the simpler examples
4. Apply concepts to your current projects

### For Teaching
- Extract sections for presentations
- Use examples in code reviews
- Reference in architectural discussions
- Include in onboarding materials

## Contributing & Feedback

These pages are living documents meant to evolve with understanding and application. Consider:
- Adding real-world case studies from HSBC work (sanitized)
- Expanding sections with additional examples
- Creating exercises and challenges
- Linking to related research and tools
